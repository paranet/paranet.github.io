Unless you’ve been off the grid for the last year, you know about ransomware’s relentless march around the globe. If your company is still untouched, consider yourself lucky. After all, Computer Weekly reports the “Locky” ransomware affected companies in at least 114 countries in the first quarter of 2016 alone.

It gets even worse. Just last month, cyber criminals spewed out almost 140,000 spam emails in just four days. Each email carried a new, “improved” variant called Zepto.

Ransomware isn’t new, though. It has been around in various forms since 1989. Whatever its form, the goal of ransomware is always the same: the criminal wants money. Earlier forms used various ways to block users’ access to their files. But today’s ransomware packs some heavy-duty cryptography. With it, it encrypts all your files, making them truly unavailable, unless you pay the ransom, that is.

So how can you protect your company from Zepto or any of its cyber cousins? With the proper care, it’s possible. The following points should help.

Scareware vs. the real deal

As we said, ransomware has been around for years. Crypto ransomeware—the kind that encrypts your data with a so-far-unbreakable key—gets the most press. But there are many less harmful variants out there. Some are annoying, with popups claiming to hold your system hostage. Other make your system unusable by locking (or blocking) your screen. In both cases, your underlying data files remain untouched.

Anti-malware can detect and remove most scareware programs. The real problem is that nowadays people assume it’s crypto ransomware. The perpetrators are banking you’ll do just that: fall for their hoax and pay up.

Prevention starts with detection

Scareware or the real thing, when it comes to ransomware we should heed the old adage. Yes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. But there’s no cure for crypto ransomware, save handing over the money. That means the best approach is to stop it before it gains a foothold.

Anti-malware software ranges from free versions like Malwarebytes to enterprise apps like Kaspersky and McAfee/Intel. Most desktop versions can scan for suspicious incoming email messages and quarantine them. Enterprise varieties do the same at the server level, stopping these messages before they arrive in the recipient’s inbox.

These programs all provide a level of protection. Their effectiveness, however, depends on how often they update their threat signature database. Cyber thieves can churn out hundreds of ransomware variants in a matter of days. With enough of a disguise, the infected emails can pass right through a malware screen.

You can also configure corporate spam filters to block emails from unknown senders and domains. This might trap an occasional innocent email, of course. Over time the filters will learn what is and what is not acceptable.

The best defense is often the simplest

As we mentioned, ransomware is almost always delivered and spread via email. If your anti-malware and spam filters fail, there’s still a simple-but-effective line of defense.

Education. Training. Security behavior policies.

Train your employees to simply not click on attachments from unknown senders. Remind them often to delete unexpected emails and files—unopened—even from known sources. Share documents and content using a repository instead of attachments. These are all simple, low-tech preventative policies. Make sure your employees know and heed them.

Keeping the infection in check—a few more tips

Despite all these barriers, someone in your organization can still open an infected file. Now what do you do?

The more cunning ransomware likes to spread itself around. Some will scan your address book and send copies to others within the company. Some may probe the local network for other vulnerable targets. Using sophisticated monitoring and intrusion detection applications, you can detect activities like these. At the very least, these can alert you of suspicious activity.

As for the infected computer or server, there’s still hope left. Turn off the machines immediately. An effective data security plan should create periodic backups for every computer in your enterprise. This lets you wipe the affected devices and restore them from the appropriate backup.

Inconvenient, perhaps. But it’s better than being held hostage.
