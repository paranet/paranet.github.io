Just how many cloud services does your company use? More importantly, how many do your employees use that you aren’t aware of?

According to data from Cisco Systems, the average company uses a whopping 1120 cloud services, over 12 times more than the 91 estimated by CIOs. Using tracking software, the company gathered usage and activity data on customer-purchased network devices, then surveyed the CIOs of those same companies. Using unauthorized cloud-based apps—many of them consumer-grade—is part of a growing problem with shadow IT.

Aside from using personal email addresses and social media, file-sharing apps account for the lion’s share of non-sanctioned employee activities, with Dropbox accounts being the most prominent.

Why? Employees need to get their jobs done, and the apps provided by company IT are either too restrictive, too clunky or just downright inconvenient to use. Employees expect what they’ve become used to on their personal devices. They want tools that make it quick and easy to do what they need to do.

How and where are they storing company data?

Dropbox isn’t the only free service employees use to share files. And there’s nothing wrong with Dropbox as a service. It’s simply that the free, personal accounts are less secure than enterprise-grade apps.

The data they are sharing—with themselves or with others—isn’t just emails and calendar events. It’s customer and employee data, including account numbers, home addresses, phone numbers and payment histories. If that wasn’t bad enough, it might also contain bank account, credit card or social security numbers.

The same is true for sensitive company data. Besides people-oriented data, files containing budgets, sales forecasts and figures, revenues, funnel and opportunity data—even trade secrets—could end up in your employees’ personal Dropboxes.

Once your data is moved to such a service, it gets copied to multiple locations, from server to desktop, from desktop to Dropbox, from Dropbox to mobile device. An employee can even access it from a friend’s computer, if it’s convenient.

Your sensitive files are now in a dozen physical locations, and you have no control over where it will end up next.

What happens to all that data?

IT might be less concerned if employees used Dropbox for Business. But that’s not the case. Unfortunately, that means IT is losing control over sensitive company information, all for the sake of employee efficiency.

Take this example. An employee pushes files to her cloud folder, so she can access it from her smartphone and her home computer. Besides the fact that the file should never have left the corporate network, what happens to the file after she finished working on it?

It’s tempting to assume a well-intentioned employee will delete the uploaded files as soon as the job’s done. But everyone knows the last thing most people think of is cleaning up their folders, at least not right away. That’s why our inboxes often have a zillion messages in them.

Even if the employee does move the files to the trash, the problem remains.

It’s true that apps like Dropbox will “sync” between all those different devices. In theory, when a file is updated or deleted in one location, the same happens in all the rest, right? Most of the time, that’s what happens—unless the file is copied elsewhere.

So, the file has:

Left the company’s servers and network.
Been pushed to personal cloud-based folder.
Been replicated to multiple locations and devices.
Been moved, renamed, versioned or otherwise altered.
Completely left the company’s control.
And all because an employee could get the job done with less hassle by using a free, personal service.

File sharing that’s the best of all worlds.

You can’t magically retrieve sensitive information spread around in this fashion, but you can take steps to prevent a repeat of this scenario. The answer? Simply provide:

Private, cloud-based file storage safely inside the corporate firewall.
Desktop and mobile apps that look, act and perform like the consumer file-sharing apps employees have come to rely on.
App installation and access for both company and personal devices.
Many file-sharing apps out there provide pay services for business solutions. These offer more storage space and encryption, plus better controls for your IT department. But most employees don’t need extra space, and even with encryption, it’s still based on the public cloud.

If you need certainty that your company data stays within your control, you need a solution built on your own private cloud. And while you can’t prevent someone using a personal file-sharing app, you can certainly discourage it by providing a private solution that’s just as simple to use.
