When major publications stop capitalizing terms like “internet” and “web,” you know those things have become commonplace. They’ve become accepted as here to stay. Even the internet of things (lowercase) is accepted as fact—even if its potential is far from being realized.

We still capitalize Big Data, though, as if we’re still not quite sure. Maybe that’s because capital Big emphasizes the data we collect today has increased by an order of magnitude. Science Daily reports 90 percent of the world’s data has been produced in the last two years.
That presents a Bigger challenge for companies trying to protect their information assets. Here are nine ways Big Data should affect your data backup and recovery strategy.

#1 Data is your business

No matter what industry, modern companies run on data. Without information systems, databases and analytics, most business would grind to a halt. Many would never have been created at all.

Imagine if your bank suddenly lost its databases. Of course, a bank has multiple (hopefully redundant) databases. But even the smallest business collects, processes and stores more vital information than ever. Whatever its size, not backing up that data makes the company vulnerable.

#2 Compliance is mandatory

Governments regulate data use practices and storage for many industries. Regulations vary with the industry; for example, financial institutions must protect and maintain various transaction data for different time periods and in different formats. The healthcare industry must protect our private health data, too. But because the volume of data keeps rising, keeping it safe and intact is more critical than ever.

#3 Data volumes are exploding

Think of it: All the data ever collected up to two years ago makes up just 10 percent of what we have today. As long as the number of IoT devices continues to rise, look for the wave of data to continue to build. Yet without an evolving approach to data protection, how will we recover that much data if disaster strikes?

#4 Location is everything

The mobile workforce continues to grow, and BYOD (bring-your-own-device) is a fact of life. Data and content are now scattered wide on laptops, tablets and smartphones, not to mention file-sharing apps—whether they are company-issued or personal. Unless backup policies account for this, you can’t have a full recovery of this bigger data in the event you need one.

#5 Disasters happen, in all shapes and sizes

No matter how prepared your infrastructure team may be, you’ll most likely face a disaster of some kind. It may be only a disk failure or power outage, but it could be a cyberattack or a natural disaster. With today’s enormous data volumes, failure of even a small device can be fatal, if the data isn’t protected.

#6 Redundancy is key

You build redundancy into your production systems, right? You also need redundancy in your data backup plan. After all, the more data you collect, the more you back up. But if the backup device or facility itself fails, what then? The key is to have multiple backup destinations, including the cloud. The cloud’s elasticity offers as much storage as you need. And if one backup should fail, the other can save you.

#7 All or nothing policies are out

With Big Data’s explosion, your backup policy can no longer treat all data the same. Even with the cloud’s elasticity, you can’t afford to store everything, all the time. Assess your data sources, determine what needs to be backed up (or not), how often and for how long. Then create an appropriate backup policy for each type.

#8 The right approach for today's data

Are you using the same storage arrays as ten years ago? Static disk arrays won’t cut it with today’s Big Data volumes. And they certainly won’t handle backing up the in-memory databases running to handle that volume. The cloud—private, public or hybrid—offers potential solutions, depending on your data’s sensitivity and compliance requirements.

#9 Recovery and continuity are king

Data backups are important for recordkeeping and regulatory compliance, but we've already said a disaster is inevitable, small or large. When your business is offline, your sales website is unreachable or your data cables are cut, you can rack up losses fast. Recovering your data is as Important as backing it up. What good is a backup without a surefire way to bring back a failed system?
