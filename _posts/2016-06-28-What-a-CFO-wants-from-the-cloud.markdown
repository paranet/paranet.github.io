subtitle: And how to deliver it.

Fortune magazine reports that while cloud adoption continues to skyrocket, there’s one big holdout in the enterprise: the chief financial officer. Up to now, the adoption rate of cloud-based financial systems has been a modest 20 percent, lagging behind almost every other enterprise application.

That could be changing now, but only if service providers, software vendors and IT can give CFOs what they really want.

Internal pressure mounts

As we’ve discussed before, the role of the CIO has been changing. The CFO has gradually absorbed the lion’s share of the CIO’s budget and purchase approval authorities, as businesses insist technology initiatives mesh with their core business strategies.

But just having the authority to make technology purchases hasn’t spurred CFOs to adopt more technology in their own departments. This includes cloud-based alternatives to financial, planning, budgeting and accounting systems, despite persuasive arguments by their technical counterparts.

But there’s one authority higher up the ladder that’s applying some pressure. According to CFO magazine, 70% of CEOs think their CFOs should invest in more cloud-based financial systems. Unfortunately, half of those same CEOs say their CFOs lack the knowledge and skills to select an appropriate technology solution.

An outside play for the CFO’s heart

There’s pressure from outside, too. With companies projected to spend over $23 billion on financial management software in 2016, the software vendors are making a big play for the CFO’s attention.

The players in this space are dividing their efforts between traditional installed applications. But given the mandates from upstairs, a CFO is likely to take a hard look at the latter. Some capabilities vendors are touting in their attempts to get a CFO to adopt their solutions are:

Budgeting, including sales, production and technology
Enterprise resource management (ERP)
AP and AR management
Asset management
Cash flow, capital and expenditure management
Statement preparation (income, expense and balance sheet)
Reporting and predictive analytics (perhaps the most important newcomer)
What a CFO really wants

To help CFOs make this decision, providers have to look at what they really want—at least from a cloud-based package.

Obviously, they’re interested in the potential savings offered by cloud-based infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure delivers flexibility and scalability without requiring constantappropriations of new capital IT budget. And SaaS is updated frequently and incrementally, with less need for long-term license purchases and upgrades. Both require less maintenance than their on-premise counterparts.

But there’s more to it than just cost savings.

CFOs want a sense of control, not just over the funds but also over the information itself. They want data and analytics available on-demand. They want more oversight of budgets and expenditures, yes, but also the insights from reporting and analysis on the data collected.

In short, they want more than just managing the books for the current quarter and fiscal year; they want control over the future. That’s where the predictive analytics found in many SaaS financial packages comes in.

Delivering what a CFO wants

But how is a CFO to choose? As mentioned earlier, many CEOs don’t trust their CFOs to make a sound, technology-related decision. That’s traditionally been IT territory.

Beyond the mandate from upstairs, choosing a cloud-based financial management solution will address many of the CFO’s needs. That means this technology initiative is clearly a high business priority. The best bet is to engage IT and a trusted managed service provider to help evaluate and choose the best SaaS solution available.
