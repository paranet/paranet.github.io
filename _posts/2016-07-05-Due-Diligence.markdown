We recently sat down for a chat with long-time client, Jim Lines, Senior Operating Partner at Thoma Bravo, one of the most experienced and successful private equity firms in the United States. For the last 15 years, Jim has turned to Paranet to help his company with due diligence. Specifically, Paranet assesses the technological health of many of Thoma Bravo’s merger and acquisition candidates and, in many cases, performs the necessary work to get a company where it needs to be from an IT perspective.

Over the last few weeks, we’ve explored a number of reasons why performing in-depth IT due diligence is a critical part of assessing a target company, including full disclosure of past information security breaches. In our conversation with Jim, he said the pervasiveness of security risks is perhaps the top reason IT due diligence should be standard practice for acquisition deals, regardless of industry.

When assessing a company’s IT health, you need to look beyond its ability to thwart an intrusion. Is your target capable of recovering after an information disaster strikes?

Disasters come in many shapes and sizes

As Jim said, probing a company’s information security past can be critical. If the company had recent breaches, you can still incur future costs. Plus, if the vulnerabilities haven’t been patched, hackers can exploit them again.

But cyberattacks aren’t the only kind of information disasters. A natural or man-made disaster can ravage a facility, taking out an entire building and the infrastructure with it. Even more common are the “smaller” disasters. A failed power supply, a crashed disk array or jittering router can make whole segments of your network inaccessible.

Whether it’s cybercrime, Mother Nature, or just aging equipment, your acquisition must be prepared to react when disaster strikes. It’s crucial you know whether it has a documented and tested disaster recovery plan (DRP) to replace or repair the damaged infrastructure. Even more important is a business continuity plan (BCP) so it can resume normal operations and customer service—even if it takes weeks or more to rebuild a physical facility.

Exposure is everything

If your target doesn’t have a tested DRP and BCP, it might not be the end of the deal. It does, however, leave the buyer exposed. Without these plans, any one of these events (or dozens of others) could take your acquisition “offline” completely. You’ll want to put a DRP in place as soon as possible.

If you’ll be integrating the acquisition into your existing operations, you might be able to extend your own DRP to cover the acquired infrastructure. It will take some time to migrate the target’s infrastructure into your own, of course. During the transition, you are vulnerable to an IT disaster, whether it’s a cyberattack, an electrical short or a lightning strike to a facility.

If the company will continue to operate on its own, you’ll need to develop a new DRP and BCP. Don’t underestimate the cost, time and infrastructure involved in putting these plans in place and adequately testing them. Until they are implemented, a disaster will leave the business exposed.

Either way, the question is simple: if a disaster of any size strikes, can you afford the exposure, the downtime and the financial damages? These risks should be factored into your assessment, TSA and the price you are willing to pay.

How quickly could you recover?

As Jim would tell you, Thoma Bravo is a firm believer in IT due diligence. He knows there are many facets to a thorough technology assessment. From scalability to software licensing, from cybersecurity to disaster recovery, you have to look under the IT hood to know if—or how quickly—that new acquisition can recover and resume operations when disaster strikes.

If your acquisition target doesn’t already have working plans for disaster recovery and business continuity, weigh the potential risks and costs before closing the deal.
