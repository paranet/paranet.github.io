People often say you should let the past be the past, or let bygones be bygones. In many aspects of life, that’s good advice. You can’t change the past, after all. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance, right?

That may be true in matters of the heart, but not in business. When you are examining a potential merger or acquisition, what you uncover during due diligence can make or break a deal. At the very least, it can affect the price you offer.

Recently we discussed how in-depth IT due diligence is as critical as careful financial assessment when considering an M&A target. After all, you wouldn’t shrug off misrepresented SEC filings, improper accounting practices or declining market shares, would you? You can’t afford to ignore costly infrastructure problems that might be hiding in the data center either.

In today’s climate of cybercrime, there’s perhaps no pitfall as critical as knowing how the company has reacted to security breaches. Here are six reasons to examine your target’s past information security (or its lack thereof).

#1 Uncovering patterns of security incidents

First, you have to determine the frequency of breaches over the last five years or so. How many malicious incidents has the company experienced? These may be either hi- or low-tech—anything from cyberattacks or denial-of-service attacks to a disgruntled employee stealing data.

It’s also important to know whether the company has intrusion detection and remediation software in place. If not, it’s possible there have been additional attacks no one even knows about.

#2 Have past breaches been contained?

Assuming the company has accurate records of these incidents, what has been done to contain each breach and limit its damage? The success of an attack often results from known (but unpatched) vulnerabilities in firewalls and other network equipment. If vendor patches haven’t been applied, another hacker can use it again.

If the company uses active intrusion detection, how rapid and effective were both the detection and subsequent actions—automated and manual—to close the vulnerability and limit the damage?

#3 Have all parties been notified?

Is the company required to publicly report security incidents and data breaches? This depends on the industry. Some—like government, finance and healthcare—have strict laws governing timely disclosure of breaches, especially where personal, financial or health data is concerned. Everyone is aware of HIPAA and HITECH regulations in the healthcare sector, but each industry has its own notification requirements.

Make sure all breaches have been reported to the appropriate authorities—not to mention the affected persons or businesses. You may be required to report them in the future, not to mention be subject to penalties for them not being reported in a timely fashion.

#4 Past breaches can mean future costs

The aftereffects of security breaches have a way of lingering. If you aren’t aware of how the target company dealt with past breaches, you may be liable for any unresolved or unpaid expenses associated with them. One example is the cost of ongoing credit monitoring for customers whose personal data was stolen.

#5 Protecting yourself from future liability

Often data theft and its aftermath mean a company is unable to renew its existing business insurance. These include liability, professional indemnity and E&O coverage. If the company has to find a new insurer because of perceived risk, the cost can be significantly higher. As the acquirer, being unaware of past breaches means you could face higher-than-expected premiums in the future.

#6 Your reputation is on the line

All other reasons aside, perhaps the worst damage a security indiscretion can inflict is to your reputation. You want to be seen as a trusted business partner, one customers can trust with their private information. You could find legacy trust—or mistrust—transferred to your company. And sometimes goodwill can take years to rebuild.

If you uncover past breaches, it doesn’t have to kill the transaction. Often just knowing the details allows the IT due diligence team to assess how much it will cost to repair the damage. That way you can either factor these costs into the offer, or at least know they are on the horizon for future budgets.
