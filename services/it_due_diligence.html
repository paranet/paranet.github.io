                <p class="lead">If you look around at all the merger-and-acquisition activity going on today,
you see a lot of deals taking place in the blind when it comes to technology.
Not that people are being scammed, necessarily, but there’s a lot of IT
window dressing being sold that’s not really functional in one way or
another.</p>
                <p>In short, too many M&As are getting this wrong, and for a whole range of
reasons. Maybe they simply don’t know what questions to ask. Maybe they simply don’t know what questions to ask.
Maybe they use an accounting firm to analyze the technology instead of someone who has experience getting under the IT hood to understand what’s really going
on.
                </p>
                <p>Maybe they try to do it themselves – just get in there and kick the tires
in hopes of getting a good understanding. And then there are those who
simply take what they hear at face value.</p>
                <p>In all cases, M&As can end in a serious case of buyer’s remorse. Failure to
account for legacy technology in calculating Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
often leads to unanticipated expenses and even possible compliance or
regulatory issues.</p>

                  <p class="m-t-20 text-white">IT Due Diligence requires additional understanding in specific areas. This primarily includes the capability, expandibility, and stability of the target company’s IT infrastructure. The personnel who perform IT Due Diligence must also know the operation and support costs of the IT department as well as the target company’s dependence on technology.</p>

                  <h2 class="m-t-0 text-white">The Process<br /><br /></h2>
                  <p class="m-t-20">Each business acquisition is a unique process, which can make effective due diligence difficult to implement. A business may acquire another business for a variety of reasons, such as diversification or eliminating a competitor. It is therefore essential to understand the reasons for an acquisition when creating a due diligence plan. IT Due Diligence becomes critical when the reason for the acquisition is to obtain the target company’s technology. The IT of the target company may be assimilated into the acquiring company or the target company may be run as a separate subsidiary.</p>

                  <p class="m-t-20">People who perform IT due diligence must know the assumptions that the acquiring company is making about the target company. These assumptions typically include growth projections and the client base. The acquiring company also needs to perform specific assessments for the target company. These include evaluations of the target company’s management and staff, identification of the key players, and individuals who are likely to leave when the company is acquired.</p>
