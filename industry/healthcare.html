Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation, whether the covered entity knew or should have known about the failure to comply, or whether the covered entity’s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. Penalties range from $100 to $50,000 or more per violation.

                        <p>The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000+ and 10 years of imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.
